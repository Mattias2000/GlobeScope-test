I made the class TestJourneys to do unit tests. test1 to test10 are the tests from the assessment, and test_extra is an extra test, to show that test10 would also work in a graph where the route could re-use roads before reaching the destination.

The Journey class is used to execute the program. The functions are explained in comments. If you run the program, it will print the results of the questions with the given graph, and it will run the tests. To change the results, you can change the graph in the first line below "if __name__ == "__main__":". This doesn't change the unit tests.
